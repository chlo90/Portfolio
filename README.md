### Projects 
This is my portfolio page where I have uploaded various projects I have done in Python and R in Jupyter Notebook. 
Note that some of the notebooks contain interactive plots (mostly using Plotly) and does not render on Github through Jupyter Notebook. 
My nbviewer directory can be found for some notebooks like this one: [Visualization using Plotly](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/chlo90/Portfolio/blob/master/Kaggle%20Zillow%20Economics%20Data.ipynb) for Kaggle Zillow Economics Data.ipynb file.
